# PRD: Organizer Management System

## Introduction/Overview

The Organizer Management System is a comprehensive admin interface that enables system administrators to efficiently manage event organizers, their assignments, and the complete organizer lifecycle. This system addresses the current gap where organizer management APIs exist but lack proper UI integration, making it difficult for admins to effectively manage organizers and their event assignments.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, administrators have no centralized way to view, manage, or assign organizers to events through the admin interface, despite having a complete backend API system. This creates inefficiencies in event management and organizer onboarding.

**Goal:** Create a complete organizer management system that provides admins with intuitive tools to manage organizers throughout their lifecycle while maintaining the existing robust API foundation.

## Goals

1. **Centralized Organizer Management:** Provide a dedicated admin interface for viewing and managing all organizers
2. **Streamlined Assignment Workflow:** Enable easy assignment and removal of organizers from events
3. **Complete Invitation System:** Implement email-based organizer invitations with proper delivery
4. **Integrated Event Management:** Seamlessly integrate organizer management into existing event management workflows
5. **Organizer Portal Enhancement:** Improve the organizer experience with better session management
6. **Comprehensive Tracking:** Track organizer activity, assignments, and system usage

## User Stories

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- **Advanced Analytics:** Complex reporting and analytics dashboards for organizers
- **Organizer Self-Registration:** Organizers cannot self-register; must be invited by admins

- **Responsive Design:** Must work on desktop and tablet devices
- **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG guidelines for accessibility
- **Loading States:** Provide clear loading indicators for all async operations
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages and recovery options

### Component Reuse
- Leverage existing UI components from the design system
- Use established patterns from student management interface
- Maintain consistency with event management components

## Technical Considerations

### Integration Points
- **Existing API Endpoints:** Build upon current organizer management APIs
- **Supabase Authentication:** Maintain integration with current auth system
- **Database Schema:** Use existing Organizer and OrganizerEventAssignment models
- **Activity Logging:** Integrate with existing activity logging system

### Performance Requirements
- **Fast Loading:** Organizer lists should load within 2 seconds
- **Efficient Queries:** Use proper database indexing and pagination
